### Intro To Exchanges

While it is possible to get cryptocurrency by through the transaction fee or mining reward in a block, the majority of Bitcoin and Ethereum users do not perform mining themselves. Additionally, many miners make payments to electricity companies using fiat currencies like the renminbi or sometimes the dollar. Many miners need to sell holdings of cryptocurrency wish to sell their holdings, while many end users who wish to transact or invest purchase it. This results in a marketplace where users need to transact between traditional fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies.

In many markets, exchanges exist to service these types of transactions. In the US, there is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) where people exchange ownership shares of companies for US Dollars and back. Currency traders also do this, when travellers wish to trade their currencies for a local currency, they can find a company to perform the exchange. At a larger scale, traders get matched up directly in a forex, where orders are opened and filled between the traders. Commodities exchanges exist as well, allowing people to buy gold, oil and agricultural goods with fiat currencies. A cryptocurrency exchange is very similar to this.
