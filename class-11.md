# Intro to Blockchain Development

### Class 11 - Hyperledger Composer Examples 

Previously, we got an introduction to Hyperledger Fabric and Composer. Now, we'll dive into some some examples surrounding them:

1. Deploying a Business Network
2. Adding Transactions and Queries
3. Access Control Language
4. Updating the Network
5. Other Concepts and Applications

Reading & Videos:

- [Securing the Diamond Trade with Blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHkc-DH0ep4)* - Here is another short IBM video detailing how a blockchain can be used by business in the diamond industryj
- [Hyperledger Fabric Architecture](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/arch-deep-dive.html) - This is a more detailed view of the architecture used in Fabric
- [Hyperledger Composer Playground Tutorial](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/v0.19/tutorials/playground-tutorial.html) - This is a tutorial for the Hyperledger Composer playground that you can follow along with. We'll cover some of the same concepts in the lecture as well.

Setup the development environment (NOTE - OSX or Ubuntu recommended):

- [Install HL Composer Prerequisites ](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/v0.19/installing/installing-prereqs) - Prerequisites for using Hyperledger Composer
- [Installing HL Composer Development Environment](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/v0.19/installing/development-tools) - Get your computer setup for Hyperledger Composer

### Deploying a Business Network

We'll be following pretty closely to the developer tutorial. You can see it [here](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/tutorials/developer-tutorial.html).

### Adding Transactions and Queries

Queries will follow from the example in [the composer docs](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/tutorials/queries).

### Access Control Language

Access control documentation can be found [here](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/reference/acl_language).

### Updating the Network

To update the network, first create a new .bna file with a different versioning following [these](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/business-network/upgrading-bna) steps. 

### Other Concepts and Applications

Please prepare any questions you have about applications and other concepts in the class.
