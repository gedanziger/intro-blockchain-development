# Week 8

This week we will have a guest lecture and explore some active topics in cryptocurrency research and development.

- **Guest Lecture - UI/UX** - Major exchange hacks, and how we can learn from them when developing custodial applications
- **Research - Scaling** - Major wallet hacks, and how we can write secure client side software
- **Research - Cryptography** - Major protocol hacks, and how to secure distributed software

Many of these topics are just starting to be proven and tested and don't have the amount of testing that Bitcoin and Ethereum offer. They do offer many benefits and are worth studying for any cryptocurrency student. More classes will be offered in depth on these topics in the future.
