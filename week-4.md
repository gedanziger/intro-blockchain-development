# Week 4

In the fourth week of the class, we will investigate private blockchains. We will cover:

- What are private/permissioned blockchains?
- Hyperledger Project - Fabric, Composer and Others
- Fabric Chaincode & Business Networks
- Private Blockchain Applications

At the end of this week, students should have a basic understanding of private blockchains, deploying their own basic permissioned blockchain. As well, students will have the opportunity to meet and discuss projects to work in in the rest of the MouseBelt University course.

We will be using Hyperledger Fabric & Composer for projects this week, so please make sure to set it up prior to the lecture if you would like to follow along. Instructions are in lecture 11.
