### Public Key Cryptography

Cryptography in general is the study of securing information. There are approaches where a single key is used to transform a message, such as the one-time pad. In this, a message is XOR-d with a shared secret key, and can then be XOR-d again to reverse it (read more about XOR [here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/XOR.html) if unfamiliar). This is an example of symmetric cryptography, where the same key performs an encrypt and decrypt operation. Other popular versions include DES and AES, subjecting a message to repeated passes to get an encrypted output. However, these require that both parties hold the same key, and must secretly transfer it before passing messages.

In the 1970s and 1980s, a new approach started with asymmetric key cryptography. In it
