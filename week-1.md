# Week 1

In the first week of the class, we will briefly cover some basic/prerequisite knowledge. Our goal in the first week is establish a foundation of the components that go into a blockchain and will be used throughout the course:

Topics covered will be:

- Public Key Cryptography
- Digital Signatures
- Distributed Systems
- Hashing
- Blockchains
- Consensus
- Cryptocurrencies
- Bitcoin

At the end of the week, we will have an optional challenge in the https://mousebelt.university forum to sign and verify a message using a bitcoin keypair. In the following weeks, we will do more work with programming and smart contracts.
