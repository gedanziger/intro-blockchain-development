# Week 5

With our starting knowledge of private blockchains & business applications, we'll explore business applications of blockchains in-depth now. Finishing up the week, we will start to take a look at wallets. We will cover the following topics:

- **More Hyperledger Examples** - Problems, common workflows and applications when dealing with supply chain data
- **Public vs. Private Blockchains** - We'll examine when to use a public ledger, when to use a private ledger, and in some cases, how to make them communicate.
- **Wallets** - How a wallet works, how to implement them, and comparing wallets across different blockchains.

We will build on previous examples using Hyperledger Composer, and use some Hyperledger Fabric commands as well. During the week, some example business networks will be uploaded for you.
