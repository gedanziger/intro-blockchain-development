# Week 5

With our starting knowledge of private blockchains & business applications, we'll explore business applications of blockchains in a bit more depth, then move on to wallets and exchanges.

- **More Hyperledger Examples** - Problems, common workflows and applications when dealing with supply chain data
- **Wallets** - How a wallet works, how to implement them, and comparing wallets across different blockchains.
- **Exchanges** - Creating a gateway from outside of a blockchain to onto a blockchain

We will build on previous examples using Hyperledger Composer, and use some Hyperledger Fabric commands as well. During the week, some example business networks will be uploaded for you.
