# Week 5

With our starting knowledge of private blockchains & business applications, we'll explore business applications of blockchains in-depth now. We will cover the following topics:

- **Supply Chains** - Problems, common workflows and applications when dealing with supply chain data
- **Coalitions, Exchanges & Consortiums** - We'll dive into an energy exchange in this application to see how a permissioned exchange/interchange works for energy.
- **Public vs. Private Blockchains** - We'll examine when to use a public ledger, when to use a private ledger, and in some cases, how to make them communicate.

We will build on previous examples using Hyperledger Composer, and use some Hyperledger Fabric commands as well. During the week, some example business networks will be uploaded for you.
