# Intro to Blockchain Development

### Class 10 - Private Blockchains

So far, we've explored Bitcoin and Ethereum extensively and got to look at smart contracts and public blockchains. This emphasizes public access and verifiability of data, with no barriers to participate in a distributed financial/compute network. However, there are a few more closed-off applications of blockchains. Next, we'll be looking at how private blockchains work through diving into the Hyperledger project. Our topics will include the following:

1. Private Blockchains
2. Permissioned Access
3. Hyperledger Foundation
4. Getting Started with Hyperledger Fabric & Composer

### Hyperledger Project

As development on private blockchains started to gather public interest, the Linux Foundation eventually endorsed it. Along with support from a few corporate partners including IBM, the [Hyperledger project](https://www.hyperledger.org/) was started. In the same manner that the [Apache Foundation](https://www.apache.org/foundation/) incubates popular open-source repositories in order to maintain production usage, the Hyperledger project offers the same services to blockchain open-source projects.

At the lecture date, the one of the most popular software packages to come from the Hyperledger project is  Hyperledger Fabric - a permissioned blockchain targeted at private deployments. In fact, when many people say that they want to "build on hyperledger", they are referring to Hyperledger Fabric or Composer (an abstraction layer on top of Fabric).
