# Week 7

This week we will investigate other consensus mechanisms.

- **Proof of Stake** - Ethereum's Casper, Tezos and other proof of stake blockchains
- **Delegated Proof of Stake** - Delegated proof of stake and how it is used to handle scaling solutions
- **Other Consensus Mechanisms** - Other consensus mechanisms and how they are used in scaling

This week will cover different consensus mechanisms beyond proof of work and HLF's standard implementation. We will investigate the positives and negatives of each solution, and how they differ from what we have explored already.
