In the second week of the class, we will dive into Ethereum, Solidity and Smart Contracts. Topics covered will be:

- Ethereum
- Smart contracts
- Applications of smart contracts
- EVM
- Solidity
- Writing a basic smart contract
- Ethereum development tools
- Useful Solidity functions

At the end of the week, students should have a basic understanding of smart contracts and be able to write one of their own.

At the end of the week the first assignment will be given out. It's an optional programming challenge to solve, based on the content presented in the class. Through the following week, students will be encouraged to deploy their own contracts and share within the forum.
