# Week 3

In the second week of the class, we work more heavily with smart contracts. Problems we will deal with include:

- Smart contract applications
- ERC20 - Fungible Tokens
- ERC721 - Non-fungible tokens
- Crowdsale, Investment & Escrow
- Common Solidity Pitfalls
- Look at solidity vulnerabilities and patches

At the end of this week, students will be able to write some common solidity contracts, as well as explore how to leverage the blockchain nature of it for some other applications. We will cover authenticating users, issuing assets, handling complex payment flows.
