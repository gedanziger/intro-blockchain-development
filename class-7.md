### Class 7 - Ethereum Application - Tokens & Assets

In this class, we'll look at the biggest single use case of Ethereum currently - the token:

1. Digital Assets and Tokens
2. Fungible Assets (ERC20)
3. Non-Fungible Assets (ERC721)
4. Optimizations and Issues
5. Use Cases

### Digital Assets and Tokens 
While Ethereum issues its own currency - Ether, one of its strongest value propositions is giving a way to issue arbitrary new assets. Once people realized they could print and sell money, it resulted in a massive amount of speculation through 2016 and 2017 in a cryptocurrency bubble. However, these assets do have some real world use-cases that we can explore. They can handle a utility - representing a currency or credit that can be redeemed, a securty - fractional ownership or a speculative asset, collectibles and more.

### Fungible Assets
The fungible asset is one of the most widely deployed contracts on the ethereum network. Proposed by the now famous ERC20 standard, it sets out to create an arbitrary new cryptocurrency with paramaeters set filling in the interface. You can see the ERC20 interface below:

```
contract ERC20Interface {
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint);
    function balanceOf(address tokenOwner) public view returns (uint balance);
    function allowance(address tokenOwner, address spender) public view returns (uint remaining);
    function transfer(address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
    function approve(address spender, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint tokens);
    event Approval(address indexed tokenOwner, address indexed spender, uint tokens);
}
```

We can now compare this to the standard default implementation, created by OpenZeppelin:

```
pragma solidity ^0.5.2;

import "./IERC20.sol";
import "../../math/SafeMath.sol";

/**
 * @title Standard ERC20 token
 *
 * @dev Implementation of the basic standard token.
 * https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md
 * Originally based on code by FirstBlood:
 * https://github.com/Firstbloodio/token/blob/master/smart_contract/FirstBloodToken.sol
 *
 * This implementation emits additional Approval events, allowing applications to reconstruct the allowance status for
 * all accounts just by listening to said events. Note that this isn't required by the specification, and other
 * compliant implementations may not do it.

##### Non-Fungible Assets
As fungible assets can be split up in smaller and smaller chunks, down to the smallest supported decimal in the contract, they have the associated advantages and disadvantages. Since there are no speciic serial numbers (which most electronic US dollar transactions also lack), it is difficult to determine how a single bill has passed around parties. In a non-fungible token, each asset is assigned a unique ID and is track-able.
